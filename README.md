# WebApp-AzureApp
I created PHP web Application and deployed it on Microsoft Azure as  part my university project. This App is managed on Azure platform, as you can see the url is a Azure free version (the url might stopped working due to limitations on free version on Azure but you can view the App code on my GitHub).
